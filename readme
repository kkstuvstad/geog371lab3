Project Name: Airports in the USA, GEOG 371 Lab 3 Winter 2019, by Kristoffer Stuvstad

Introduction: This project displays a web map of airport locations in the United States, as well as marking airport
locations that have control towers.

Description: This project used the coding language HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GeoJSON files. HTML was used to create
structure for the outline of the map display on an internet browser. CSS was used to add style to the map as well as
the legend to help the viewer distinguish each feature by elements and colors. JavaScript was essentially the backbone,
providing the elements to the map, setting the colors in place, and creating functions to allow interactivity with the
points.
